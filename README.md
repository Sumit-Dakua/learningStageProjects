# learningStageProjects
these are my experimental projects to learn specific topics or technologies to test my new skills. feel free to explore this repo to view basic and fundamental things 
i like to add comments to most of my code so that its easier to understand when time comes 
and i return to the brush up my fundamentals a bit.
